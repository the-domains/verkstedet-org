Helge was born in Norway,1942\. The second world war was raging in Europe
and he had like many other children at that time - Polio. After many 
broken limbs the doctors at the time decided to fixate his left arm with
a screw to scapula and his left leg had the supporting function of a 
crouch.

Despite a tough start, Helge has been a very successful 
man professionally.  He studied first as a photographer and teacher 
(1964), then followed drama studies at The Rose Bruford Training 
College, Central School of Speech and Drama and Royal Academy of Music, 
London. He is theatre director and drama/mime teacher. Helge Reistad 
helped organize drama in education in the 1960's, directed one of 
Norway's leading theatre companies ("Musidra") in the 1970's and 
introduced drama in the curriculum at the University Colleges. He has 
organized and directed research projects in theatre for small children.

A 
life on medication, due to his condition and lots of work made him 
finally hit the "wall" as he became 60 years old. Doctors said they 
couldn't help him and subscribed more medication. The end felt near for 
Helge but when you think it is over, new hope arise: He was not done 
yet.  
Life took a different turn in 2006 when he met Michael 
Jansson, the manual therapist, who started the change no-one thought was
possible. 

Major steps in the process where - balance structure with 
manual hands-on methods, re-educate the brain get rid of medication and everything in the diet that limits human development. 

Helge
is today 73 years old. He walks on two legs healthier than many of his 
friends of the same age-group. He is progressing every day, thanks to 
good rituals and a new life-pattern he learned from Michael Jansson. 
Helge Reistad describes this in chapter four in his book from 2012 "Se meg - en personlig essay" 
([Teater.as][0], 2012) 

Michael Janssons 15 years of experience from treating people 
like Helge and other people in pain has resulted in the 
"Verkstedet-method". The treatment protocol that guarantees change from pain 
to performance. Money-back guarantee if there is no definite change of homeostatic conditions. 

**Get inspired to change!**

* Watch movie about how Michael Jansson changed Helges Polio condition through manual treatment focusing on structure, nutrition and emotion. The experience with treating Helge amongst many other patients resulted in the change concept "Pimp My Boody" and later the "Verksted-method".
