Similar tests have been made and is often used by professional sport athletes to secure progress in training and prevent injury. But aren't we all professionals in the sense that we are working every day and need a functional body to support our own life?

These functional movement tests can complement the tests made by your doctor and other body composition measures. All illustrated at the same place for a better overview, easier analysis and better solution.

The dynamic portal consists of over **100s different standards** that in a specific combination will secure humans as "sapiens" and make you feel quality in life. Dots in red field equals pain or "severe" improvement needed, black field ok but not good and the closer you come to the middle the better feel and the better you perform. You get what you test.

We call this batch of functional test for what it actually is - **B.A.C. (Body Analysis of the Current)**

Welcome and get mapped the way out of trouble!

_Best regards and good health!_
