**Wondered how skiing felt like when you where a kid? Have you thought about when skiing took a different turn and wasn't as fun or gave you the same kind of sensation as it used to do? Have you ever wondered why?**

Dealing with injuries and periods with lack of motivation affects our possibility to maximize the moment of skiing down a mountain. Equipment, friends, weather and environment plays definitely a big role in this game but pain, endurance,strength, flexibility and the all combined balance as well as progress in skiing is probably the most significant factors that set limits to having the most awesome day on the mountain and maintain passion and keep on skiing with the biggest smile!

Pimp My Skiing(c) is an extension of Michael Janssons Pimp My body(c) treatment protocol and aim to increase performance in every aspect of your skiing. The customized batch of physical tests highlights body functions used in skiing. The initial batch of physical test to benchmark your current physical status, then you receive 4 treatments and finally we test you again so you can see, feel and be sure that change and improvement is awesome. The concept directs all people hitting a wall in development, in pain or want to somewhat restore function of "lost" body parts.

_The recent [press-release][0] (17.11.2015) reveals the initial results of Pimp my Body and explains testing, treatment and short explanation on how the results where achieved._

Jansson's PMB protocol has three pillars---structure, nutrition, and emotion--- and combines advanced manual therapy, cold laser, nutritional hacking, stress management and neuroplasticity-based training, such as Foundation Training(c) and Z-Health(c).

Recently Jansson tested the method using the health platform CheckUp(c) and collection of functional tests called B.A.C. (Body Analysis of the Current). The program measured the functionality of five participants before (blue dots) and after (white dots) four treatment sessions with Jansson.

Participants visited massage therapist and CheckUp(c) test leader Pontus Lüttkens to evaluate their physical functionality. Each performed a series of 20 standardized exercises to test core strength, agility, balance and stamina. Then they underwent four treatment sessions with Jansson, who integrated their structures, implemented simple nutritional hacks (low carb, sugar and gluten) and taught them the basic Foundation Training(c) exercise. After completing the four sessions, the participants returned to Lüttkens for a new series of tests. All of the participants showed improved agility, core strength and balance. "They all performed better on more than 50% of the exercises, and all improved on the most critical exercises," according to Lüttkens, who uses the CheckUp system to test his own clients as well.

**What makes Jansson's method so effective?**

"The study is the result of 15 years of exploration, trying to find out what works and what doesn't work," said Jansson. The difference between Jansson's method and traditional chiropractic and physical therapies is the neuroplasticity-based approach that emphasizes movement re-education, upgraded nutrition, and positive emotional input. Simply stated, along with advanced manual adjustments, clients learn to eat better, think positive and move smarter to combat degeneration caused by their lifestyles but also their unique genetic heritage. "Also, my clients are highly motivated to be pain free and live a fuller life," said Jansson. "It works, even if you don't believe in the science".

> The results show what modern science tells us, the brain is adaptable and is the control center of pain. Instead of merely treating pain symptoms, I aim to restore function through manual adjustments and nutrition and to re-educate people so they move as they were designed to move. I am convinced that my method makes people pain free faster than traditional physical therapies and chiropractic treatments. -- Michael Jansson

Rather than treating the symptom, Verkstedet-method reeducates your body and your brain, argues Jansson. I have used the method on severe cases of chronic pain, polio survivors, and other "incurable" conditions that doctors and other therapists have failed to treat successfully.

Swedish-born Jansson is an expert with 15 years of experience with percussor machine-assisted adjustments. This almost too good to be true machine provides a pain-free effective treatment. A session takes about one hour. Most people need 2-4 sessions to experience less pain achieve and better function. In addition to the manual adjustments and cold-laser treatment, clients learn exercise techniques that integrate their structure and nervous system. The stress-reduction component teaches meditation for people who hate to meditate (or have no time to do it).

**What next?**

In the next phase of demonstrating the effectiveness of his method, Jansson plans to analyze blood samples, test insulin sensitivity and other indicators of new participants before and after treatment. "My goal is not to keep my clients dependent on me by treating their symptoms from week to week, but to make them independent from me. You can't treat the condition, you have to change it," argues Jansson.

* Body Analysis of the Current (B.A.C.) are based at [Markveien Naturmedisinske Senter][1] but if necessary located on appropriate arena.
* Verkstedet-method treatment protocol is performed at [Verkstedet Klinkikk.][2]

**Would like to know more?**

We have planned for two free workshops in 2016 where we present ourselves and the concept. Dates are - **January 16th** & **February 13th**

Fee 300 Nok - More info is coming soon
