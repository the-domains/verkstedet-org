Equipment, friends, weather and environment playsdefinitely a big role in this game but pain, endurance, strength, flexibility and the allcombined balance as well as progress in skiing is probably the most significant factors thatset limits to having the most awesome day on the mountain and maintain passion and keepon skiing with the biggest smile!

> You can't treat the condition, you have to change it - Michael Jansson

Pimp My Skiing(c) is an extension of Michael Janssons Pimp My body(c) treatment protocol and aim to increase performance in every aspect of your skiing. The customized batch of physical tests highlights body functions used in skiing. The initial batch of physical test to benchmark your current physical status, then you receive 4 treatments by Jansson's PMB-protocol and finally we test you again so you can see, feel and be sure that change and improvement is awesome.

Pimp My Skiing directs all people hitting a wall in development, in pain or want to somewhat restore function of "lost" body parts.
