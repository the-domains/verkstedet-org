**Pimp my golf..skiing....life! You name it...this is the result after 2 test (benchmark & followup) and 4 treatments (PMBs). Blue (small) dots before PMB. This man was in pain. White (big) dots after 4 treatments.**

Our testperson improved on over 95% of tested standards. He made a few less pushups (27 instead of 32) but each pushup had power and disinction, his posture was good and no pain what-so-ever.

* Major improvement in neck movability!
* Major improvement on overhead squats!
* Major improvement in balance!
* Major improvement in quad-strength!
* Major improvement in core strenght!
