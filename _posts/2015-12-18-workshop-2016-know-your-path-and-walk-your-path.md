Based on the press-release, [17.11.2015][0], and an increasing demand from the public we are happy to announce the Verkstedet-method / Pimp My Body (PMB) has scheduled workshops, throughout 2016 starting the **16th of January**, where the verkstedet-method is presented holistically by the founder of PMB, Michael Jansson together with Verkstedet Clinic,sindre Haga Andreassen and Pontus LÃ¼ttkens, founder of BAC, co-owner at Markveien Naturmedisinske Senter.

> Sooner or later. You're gonna realize, just like we 'did. There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

Michael Janssons' PMB-protocol goes fearless in and becomes the first treatment protocol ever that systematically quality checks output after treatments. This has never been done before! And this is the results so far, [BAC after 4 treatments][1].
