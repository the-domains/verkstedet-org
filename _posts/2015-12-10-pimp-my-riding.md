PMB, Pimp My Riding(c) is an extension of Michael Janssons Pimp My body(c) treatment protocol and aim to increase performance in every aspect of your riding. Initially, a customized batch of physical tests highlights body functions used in riding. Then you recieve 4 treatments by Janssons PMB protocol and finally we test you again on the same standards, so you can see, feel and be sure that improvement is awesome.

Jansson's PMB protocol has three pillars---structure, nutrition, and emotion--- and combines advanced manual therapy, cold laser, nutritional hacking, stress management and neuroplasticity-based training, such as Foundation Training(c)and Z-Health(c)

Pimp My Riding directs people specifically who want to improve their riding experience. Less injuries, better contact with the horse and more F-U-N!!
