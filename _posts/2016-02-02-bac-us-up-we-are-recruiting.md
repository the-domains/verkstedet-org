**I am looking for people with passion and real life experiences. You can be a proffesional athlete, experienced ski-teacher, climber, gym-teachers, windsurfers, surfers, personal trainers, athletic therapists and others with the love for all kinds of sports. Actually you can also be a musician, song-teacher, artist...The keyword is body-awareness, an interest to learn and analytical skills!**

When your career peaks, and start to fall you're still a very competent person with experiences worth sharing. I am here giving you an offer you can either ignore or make it yours.

I know that you have skills that todays society lacks. Today; kids, young people and adults need your playful heart, your passion and your knowledge about how the body moves and function within various fields.

Do you feel your heart is pumping?

Send me you contact info and I will give you a call. I am to meet in Oslo or in the Norwegian mountains.

_Good health and happy life! _
