# About Foundation Training

<article style=""><h1>Creators: Dr. Eric Goodman</h1><p>When you arrive at Dr. Eric Goodman's Carpenteria home and Foundation Training base camp, you're instantaneously at ease. It's mostly the super-relaxed vibe Goodman and his business partners/friends emanate as they stroll barefoot along the patio. (The dogs running up and down the stairs have a little to do with it, too.)</p><img src="http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Featured.jpg" /></article>
