# PRESSRELEASE \[17.11.2015\]

MICHAEL JANSSON'S "VERKSTEDET" TREATMENT PROTOCOL, "BEST IN TEST" FOR ENDING CHRONIC PAIN AND RESTORING FUNCTION.

Michael Jansson, manual medicine practitioner and founder of The Verkstedet Clinic Michael Jansson and Pimp My Body demonstrates that his unique treatment protocol (Verkstedet-method) fixes chronic pain and improves functionality quickly and effectively.

Jansson's protocol has three pillars---structure, nutritional, and emotion---and combines advanced manual therapy, cold laser, nutritional hacking, stress management and neuroplasticity-based training, such as Foundation Training(c) and Z-Health(c) and collection of functional tests called B.A.C. (Body Analysis of the Current). The program measured the functionality of five participants before and after four treatment sessions with Jansson.

Participants visited massage therapist and CheckUp(c) test leader Pontus L端ttkens to evaluate their physical functionality. Each performed a series of 20standardized exercises to test core strength, agility, balance and stamina. Then they underwent four treatment sessions with Jansson, who integrated their structures, implemented simple nutritional hacks (low carb, sugar and gluten) and taught them the basic Foundation Training(c)exercise. After completing the four sessions, the participants returned to L端ttkens for a new series of tests. All of the participants showed improved agility, core strength and balance. "They all performed better on more than 50% of the exercises, and all improved on the most critical exercises," according to L端ttkens, who uses the CheckUp(c)system to test his own clients as well.

> The most significant change was that all participants improved core strength, they were pain free, and their faces were happy even though their lives were just as busy as before their sessions with Jansson, said L端ttkens.

**What makes Jansson's method so effective?**

The study is the result of 15 years of exploration, trying to find out what works and what doesn't work, said Jansson. The difference between Jansson's method and traditional chiropractic and physical therapies is the neuroplasticity-based approach that emphasizes movement re-education, upgraded nutrition, and positive emotional input. Simply stated, along with advanced manual adjustments, clients learn to eat better, think positive and move smarter to combat degeneration caused by their lifestyles but also their unique genetic heritage. Also, my clients are highly motivated to be pain free and live a fuller life, said Jansson.

> It works, even if you don't believe in the science".

The results show what modern science tells us, the brain is adaptable and is the control center of pain. Instead of merely treating pain symptoms, I aim to restore function through manual adjustments and nutrition and to re-educate people so they move as they were designed to move. I am convinced that my method makes people pain free faster than traditional physical therapies and chiropractic treatments. Rather than treating the symptom, Verkstedet-method reeducates your body and your brain, argues Jansson. I have used the method on severe cases of chronic pain, polio survivors, and other "incurable" conditions that doctors and other therapists have failed to treat successfully.

Swedish-born Jansson is an expert with 15 years of experience with percussor machine-assisted adjustments. This almost too good to be true machine provides a pain-free effective treatment. A session takes about one hour. Most people need 2-4 sessions to experience less pain achieve and better function. In addition to the manual adjustments and cold-laser treatment, clients learn exercise techniques that integrate their structure and nervous system. The stress-reduction component teaches meditation for people who hate to meditate (or have no time to do it).

**What next?**

In the next phase of demonstrating the effectiveness of his method, Jansson plans to analyze blood samples, test insulin sensitivity and other indicators of new participants before and after treatment. "My goal is not to keep my clients dependent on me by treating their symptoms from week to week, but to make them independent from me. You can't treat the condition, you have to change it," argues Jansson.
