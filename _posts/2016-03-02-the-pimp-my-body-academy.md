## Are you a therapist who wants to step 
up your game? Get the PMB edge! 

**Welcome to the most awesome training in spatial medicine!**
Learn the 4-step PMB protocol to optimize structure, nutrition, emotion and movement (SNEM). This 
is an effective, fun and challenging training for therapists who want to make an impact, both for 
clients and yourself. 

**The course** teaches effective and documented techniques that give long-lasting benefits to your 
clients and takes them out of their pain and misery. The training builds on 15 years of practice, 
thousands of hours of training and teaching, not to mention endless trials and errors. The result is an 
amazing system, probably the best you can find. AND it is testable! 

**The training** combines practical advanced-movement education with very effective manual 
techniques. Learn to use structure, nutrition, emotion and movement to treat your clients using the 
transformative benefits of neuroplasticity.
Master the PMB system, and learn how to test your clients. Your clients can follow their own process 
and after only 4 sessions they are tested again. Read the results of our study, _[BAC after 4 treatments][0]_

60 hours of intense training, great colleagues and a very experienced teacher. The training will take place 3 weekends, one weekend a month in April, May and June. 

**Your investment:** 15.000 NOK.
8-10 April 2016 is the next training. 

**What you will learn:**

* Effective posture-changing and scientifically-proven strategies.

special forces.
